# DogeWM
DogeWM is a lightweight tabbed X11 window manager for GNU/Linux and FreeBSD.
(WARNING: This project is not finished yet.)

DogeWM aims to make an experience that manages your windows using a single fullscreen tabbed window. It doesn't have workspaces.
The desktop will be a dock at the middle and a status bar at the bottom-right corner when it's empty. When a window opens, the dock and status bar merges onto a single bar at the bottom and entire free space left will be a tabbed window.

# How to install
To install DogeWM, run this commands:
<code>
git clone https://github.com/mrdoge0/DogeWM.git
cd DogeWM
chmod +x ./install.sh
./install.sh
</code>
